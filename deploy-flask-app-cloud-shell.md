  * [Cloud Shell](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/cloudshellintro.htm)

## Before You Begin

To successfully perform this tutorial, you must have the following:

[Requirements](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/developer-tutorials/tutorials/flask-cloud-shell/01oci-flask-shell-summary.htm#)

  * A **paid** Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account. See [Signing Up for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/signingup.htm).
  * Cloud Shell provides the following applications:
    * JDK 8+
    * Python 3.6.8+
    * Kubectl 1.18.10+
    * Apache Maven 3.5+
    * Docker 19.0.11+

** Note**  
  
The advantage of using Cloud Shell is all the required tools to manage your application are already installed and ready to use.

## 1. Prepare

Prepare your environment to create and deploy your application.

[Check your Service Limits](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/developer-tutorials/tutorials/flask-cloud-shell/01oci-flask-shell-summary.htm#)

  1. Log in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure **Console**.
  2. Open the navigation menu, and click Governance and Administration. Under Governance, click Limits, Quotas and Usage.
  3. Find your service limit for **Regions**:
    * **Filter** for the following options:
      * **Service:** Regions
      * **Scope:** Tenancy
      * **Resource:** Subscribed region count
      * **Compartment:** `<tenancy-name>` (root)
    * Find service limit:
      * **Limit Name:** `subscribed-region-count`
      * **Service Limit: **minimum 2
  4. Find your available **Compute** **core count** for the **VM.Standard.E2.1** shape:
    * **Filter** for the following options:
      * **Service:** Compute
      * **Scope:** `<first-availability-domain>`. Example: `EMlr:US-ASHBURN-AD-1`
      * **Resource:** **Cores** for Standard.E2 based VM and BM Instances
      * **Compartment:** `<tenancy-name>` (root)
    * Find available core count:
      * **Limit Name:** `standard-e2-core-count`
      * **Available: **minimum 1
    * Repeat for **Scope:** `<second-availability-domain>` and `<third-availability-domain>`. Each region must have at least one core available for this shape.
  5. Find out if you have **50 GB** of **Block Volume** available:
    * **Filter** for the following options:
      * **Service:** Block Volume
      * **Scope:** `<first-availability-domain>`. Example: `EMlr:US-ASHBURN-AD-1`
      * **Resource** Volume Size (GB)
      * **Compartment:** `<tenancy-name>` (root)
    * Find available core count:
      * **Limit Name: **`total-storage-gb`
      * **Available: **minimum 50
    * Repeat for **Scope:** `<second-availability-domain>` and `<third-availability-domain>`. Each region must have at least 50 GB of block volume available.
  6. Find out how many **Flexible Load Balancers** you have available:
    * **Filter** for the following options:
      * **Service:** LBaaS
      * **Scope:** `<your-region>`. Example: `us-ashburn-1`
      * **Resource:** <blank>
      * **Compartment:** `<tenancy-name>` (root)
    * Find the count for the following shapes
      * **Limit Name:** `lb-flexible-bandwidth-count`
      * **Available: **minimum 1

** Note**  
  
This tutorial creates three compute instances with a **VM.Standard.E2.1** shape for the cluster nodes. To use another shape, filter for its **core count**. For example, for **VM.Standard2.4**, filter for **Cores for Standard2 based VM and BM Instances** and get the **count**. 

For a list of all shapes, see [VM Standard Shapes](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/References/computeshapes.htm#vmshapes__vm-standard).

** Note**  
  
This tutorial creates a load balancer with a **flexible** shape. To use another bandwidth, filter for its **count**, for example **100-Mbps bandwidth** or **400-Mbps bandwidth**.

  8. Click **Create Cluster**.

The services set up for your cluster are displayed.

  9. Click **Close**.
  10. Get a cup of coffee. It takes a few minutes for the cluster to be created.
You have successfully created a Kubernetes cluster.

[Configure Cloud Shell to Access to Your Cluster](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/developer-tutorials/tutorials/flask-cloud-shell/01oci-flask-shell-summary.htm#)

After you create a Kubernetes cluster, set up your local system to access the cluster.

  1. Sign in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure **Console**.
  2. Open the navigation menu and click **Developer Services**. Under **Containers & Artifacts**, click**Kubernetes Clusters (OKE)**.
  3. Click the link to **`<your-cluster>`**.

The information about your cluster is displayed.

  4. Click Access Cluster.
  5. Click Cloud Shell Access. Follow the steps in the dialog. The following steps are provided for your reference.
  6. From the main menu, click the Cloud Shell icon (![](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/developer-tutorials/tutorials/common/k8s-cs/images/cloud_shell_icon.png)) and start a session.
  7. Check your `oci` CLI version and verify that Cloud Shell is working.

Copy
    
    oci -v

  8. Make your `.kube` directory if it doesn't exist.

Copy
    
    mkdir -p $HOME/.kube

  9. Create kubeconfig file for your setup. Use the information from **Access Your Cluster **dialog.
    
    oci ce cluster create-kubeconfig <use data from dialog>

** Note**  
  
If the `config` file is not stored in its default location (`~/.kube/config`, you must export the`KUBECONFIG` environment variable to point to the location.

Copy
    
    export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/<new-location>/config

** Note**  
  
When working with more than one cluster, you specify a specific config file on the command line. Example:

Copy
    
    kubectl --kubeconfig=</path/to/config/file> <some-command>

  10. Test your cluster configuration with the following command.

List clusters:

Copy
    
    kubectl get service

With your cluster access setup, you are now ready to prepare your application for deployment.

  

## 3. Build your Docker Application

Next, set up the Flask framework on Cloud Shell. Then, create and run a Python application. 

[Create a Local Application](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/developer-tutorials/tutorials/flask-cloud-shell/01oci-flask-shell-summary.htm#)

Create your Flask application.

  1. Install Flask.

Copy
    
    pip3 install --user Flask

  2. Create a directory for your application.

Copy
    
    mkdir python-hello-app

  3. Change to the `python-hello-app` directory.

Copy
    
    cd python-hello-app

  4. Create a "Hello, World!" application.

Create the file:

Copy
    
    vi hello.py

In the file, input the following text:

Copy
    
    from flask import Flask
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    @app.route('/')
    def hello_world():
        return '<h1>Hello World from Flask!</h1>'
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=int("5000"), debug=True)

  5. Save the file.

[Run the Local Application](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/developer-tutorials/tutorials/flask-cloud-shell/01oci-flask-shell-summary.htm#)

Run your Flask application.

  1. Run the Python program.

Copy
    
    export FLASK_APP=hello.py
    export FLASK_ENV=development
    python3 hello.py

Produces the following output:
    
    * Serving Flask app 'hello' (lazy loading)
    * Environment: development
    * Debug mode: on
    * Running on all addresses.
    WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
    * Running on http://x.x.x.x:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    * Restarting with stat
    * Debugger is active!
    * Debugger PIN: xxx-xxx-xxx                    

  2. Move the app to the background.

    * Hit **Ctrl z**.
    * Enter the following command: `bg`

  3. Test the app using `curl`.

In Cloud Shell terminal, enter the following code:

Copy
    
    curl -X GET http://localhost:5000

Output:
    
    <h1>Hello World from Flask!</h1>

  4. Stop the running application.

    * When you are done testing, get the process ID for your application.

Copy
    
    ps -ef

    * Stop the process.

Copy
    
    kill <your-pid>

You have successfully created a local Python application with the Flask framework.

**References:**

For more information on Flask, see [Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/).

[Build a Docker Image](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/developer-tutorials/tutorials/flask-cloud-shell/01oci-flask-shell-summary.htm#)

Next, create a Docker image for your Flask application.

  1. First, ensure you are in the `python-hello-app` directory.
  2. Create a file named `Dockerfile`:

Create the file:

Copy
    
    vi Dockerfile

In the file, input the following text and save the file:

Copy
    
    FROM python:3.9-slim-buster
    ADD hello.py /
    COPY . /app
    WORKDIR /app
    RUN pip3 install Flask
    EXPOSE 5000
    CMD [ "python3", "./hello.py" ]

  3. Build a Docker image: 

Copy
    
    docker build -t python-hello-app .

You get a success message.
    
    [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
    Successfully tagged python-hello-app:latest

  4. Run the Docker image: 

Copy
    
    docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 python-hello-app:latest &

  5. Test the application using the `curl` command:

Copy
    
    curl -X GET http://localhost:5000

If you get `<h1>Hello World from Flask!</h1>`, then the Docker image is running. Now you can push the image to Container Registry.

  6. Stop the running application.

    * When you are done testing, get the process ID for your application.

Copy
    
    ps -ef

    * Stop the process.

Copy
    
    kill <your-pid>

Congratulations! You have successfully created a Python Flask Docker image.

  

## 4. Deploy Your Docker Image

With your Python image created, now you can deploy it.

[Create a Docker Repository](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/developer-tutorials/tutorials/flask-cloud-shell/01oci-flask-shell-summary.htm#)

  1. Open the navigation menu and click **Developer Services**. Under **Containers & Artifacts**, click**Container Registry**.
  2. In the left navigation, select `<your-compartment-name>`.
  3. Click Create Repository.
  4. Create a **private repository** with your choice of repo name:

Copy
    
    <repo-name> = <image-path-name>/<image-name>

Example: `flask-apps/python-hello-app`

You are now ready to push your local image to Container Registry.

** Note**  
  
Before you can push a Docker image into a registry repository, **the repository must exist in your compartment**. If the repository does not exist, the Docker push command does not work correctly.

** Note**  
  
The slash in a repository name **does not represent a hierarchical directory structure**. The optional `<image-path-name>` helps to organize your repositories.

[Push Your Local Image](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/developer-tutorials/tutorials/flask-cloud-shell/01oci-flask-shell-summary.htm#)

With your local Docker image created, push the image to the Container Registry.

Follow these steps.

  1. Open a terminal window.
  2. Log in to Container Registry:

Copy
    
    docker login <region-key>.ocir.io

You are prompted for your login name and password.

    * **Username:** `<tenancy-namespace>/<user-name>`
    * **Password:** `<auth-token>`

  3. List your local Docker images:

Copy
    
    docker images

The Docker images on your system are displayed. Identify the image you created in the last section: `python-hello-app`

  4. **Tag** your local image with the **URL for the registry** plus the **repo name**, so you can push it to that repo.

Copy
    
    docker tag <your-local-image> <repo-url>/<repo-name>

    * Replace `**<repo-url>**` with:
    
    <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/

    * Replace `**<repo-name>**` with:

`<image-folder-name>/<image-name>` from the **Create a Docker Repository** section.

    * Here is an example after combining both:
    
    docker tag python-hello-app iad.ocir.io/my-namespace/flask-apps/python-hello-app

In this example, the components are:

      * **Repo URL:** `iad.ocir.io/my-namespace/`
      * **Repo name:** `flask-apps/python-hello-app`

** Note**  
  
OCI Container Registry now supports creating a registry repo in any compartment rather than only in the root compartment (tenancy). To push the image to the repo you created, combine the registry URL with the exact repo name. OCI Container Registry matches based on the unique repo name and pushes your image.

  5. Check your Docker images to see if the image is **copied**.

Copy
    
    docker images

    * The tagged or the **copied image** has **the same image ID** as your local image.
    * The **copied image name** is:
    
    <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<image-folder-name>/<image-name>

  6. Push the image to Container Registry.

Copy
    
    docker push **<copied-image-name>**:latest

Example:
    
    docker push iad.ocir.io/my-namespace/flask-apps/python-hello-app:latest

  7. Open the navigation menu and click **Developer Services**. Under **Containers & Artifacts**, click**Container Registry**.

Find your image in Container Registry after the push command is complete.

[Deploy the Image](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/developer-tutorials/tutorials/flask-cloud-shell/01oci-flask-shell-summary.htm#)

With your image in Container Registry, you can now deploy your image and app.

  1. Create a registry secret for your application. This secret authenticates your image when you deploy it to your cluster.

To create your secret, fill in the information in this template .

Copy
    
    kubectl create secret docker-registry ocirsecret --docker-server=<region-key>.ocir.io  --docker-username='<tenancy-namespace>/<user-name>' --docker-password='<auth-token>'  --docker-email='<email-address>'

After the command runs, you get a message similar to: `secret/ocirsecret created`.

  2. Verify that the secret is created. Issue the following command:

Copy
    
    kubectl get secret ocirsecret --output=yaml

The output includes information about your secret in the yaml format.

  3. Determine the host URL to your registry image using the following template:

Copy
    
    <region-code>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>

Example:
    
    iad.ocir.io/my-namespace/flask-apps/python-hello-app:latest

  4. On your system, create a file called `app.yaml` with the following text:

Replace the following place holders:
    * `<your-image-url>`
    * `<your-secret-name>`

Copy
    
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: app
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: app
      replicas: 3
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: app
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: app
            image: <your-image-url>
            imagePullPolicy: Always
            ports:
            - name: app
              containerPort: 5000
              protocol: TCP
          imagePullSecrets:
            - name: <your-secret-name>
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: app-lb
      labels:
        app: app
      annotations:
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/oci-load-balancer-shape: "flexible"
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/oci-load-balancer-shape-flex-min: "10"
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/oci-load-balancer-shape-flex-max: "100"
    spec:
      type: LoadBalancer
      ports:
      - port: 5000
      selector:
        app: app

  5. Deploy your application with the following command.

Copy
    
    kubectl create -f app.yaml

Output: 
    
    deployment.apps/app created

** Note**  
  
In the `app.yaml` file, the code after the dashes adds a flexible load balancer.

[Test Your App](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/developer-tutorials/tutorials/flask-cloud-shell/01oci-flask-shell-summary.htm#)

After you deploy your app, it might take the load balancer a few seconds to load.

  1. Check if the load balancer is live:

Copy
    
    kubectl get service

Repeat the command until load balancer is assigned an IP address.

** Note**  
  
While waiting for the load balancer to deploy, you can check the status of your cluster with these commands: 
    * Get each pods status: `kubectl get pods`
    * Get app status: `kubectl get deployment`

  2. Use the load balancer IP address to connect to your app in a browser:

Copy
    
    http://<load-balancer-IP-address>:5000

The browser displays: `<h1>Hello World from Flask!</h1>`

  3. Undeploy your application from the cluster. **(Optional)** To remove your application run this command:

Copy
    
    kubectl delete -f app.yaml

Output:
    
    deployment.apps/python-hello-app deleted
    service "python-hello-app-lb" deleted

Your application is now removed from your cluster.

## What's Next

You have successfully created a Hello World Python application, deployed it to a Kubernetes cluster and made it accessible on the internet, using the Flask framework.
